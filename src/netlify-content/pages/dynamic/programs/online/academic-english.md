  The FLS Academic English Program is perfect for students who want to improve
  their English skills as quickly as possible and get on the right track for
  college and university success!  This program offers the most lessons per week
  available at FLS.  Students will study in our core integrated skills class,
  will attend a daily workshop, and have a choice of either two electives, a
  test preparation class, or our high school completion course. 


  #### TEACHERS


  All of our teachers are based in the United States and speak native-proficient level English. Every teacher has a TEFL Certificate or Master's Degree and extensive instructional experience.


  #### LIVE INSTRUCTION


  Every lesson is given with live instruction, so your teacher is always there to provide feedback and correction. You'll meet and practice with students from around the world as you improve your English skills together!


  As part of our Online Pathway Program you will participate via webcam with a live in-person class.
