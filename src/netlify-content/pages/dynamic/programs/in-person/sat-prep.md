  Gain the edge in preparing for university admission with our thorough SAT
  Preparation Program!


  The Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, is the most commonly used standard exam in undergraduate admissions for American colleges and universities. Throughout the United States, high school juniors and seniors prepare extensively for the exam, making it critical for non-native speaking international students to get an edge in their SAT test preparation.


  The SAT is designed specifically to test skills that students have learned in the American high school system, putting students from other systems at a disadvantage. With our expertise in teaching international students, FLS is ideally suited to give you a solid foundation for SAT success!


  Our intensive program includes a total of 36 teacher-led lessons per week: 18 lessons of integrated study to improve all English skills; 12 lessons devoted to specific SAT strategies and skills and 6 lessons of Academic Workshops for additional language practice and skill development.


  Students work with experienced, carefully selected instructors to hone their ability in the SAT skills of Critical Reading, Writing and Mathematics. Practice exams allow instructors to analyze studentsâ€™ abilities and familiarize students with the test format and strategies.


  Please note that students must possess an English fluency of FLS Level 13 or better to enter the SAT Program.
