  The world was young, the mountains green\
  *No stain yet on the Moon was seen*\
  No words were laid on stream or stone\
  **When Durin woke and walked alone**

  * He named the nameless hills and dells\
    He drank from yet untasted wells\
    He stooped and looked in Mirrormere\
    And saw a crown of stars appear
  * As gems upon a silver thread\
    Above the shadow of his head

  [The world was fair, the mountains tall](www.google.com)\
  In Elder Days before the fall\
  Of mighty Kings in Nargothrond\
  And Gondolin, who now beyond

  The Western Seas have passed away\
  The world was fair in Durin's Day

  A king he was on carven throne\
  In many-pillared halls of stone\
  With golden roof and silver floor\
  And runes of power upon the door\
  The light of sun and star and moon\
  In shining lamps of crystal hewn\
  Undimmed by cloud or shade of night\
  There shown forever far and bright

  There hammer on the anvil smote\
  There chisel clove, and graver wrote\
  There forged was bladed and bound was hilt\
  The delver mined the mason built\
  There beryl, pearl, and opal pale\
  And metel wrought like fishes' mail\
  Buckler and corslet, axe and sword\
  And shining spears were laid in horde

  Unwearied then were Durin's folk\
  Beneath the mountains music woke\
  The harpers harped, the minstrels sang\
  And at the gates the trumpets rang

  The world is grey, the mountains old\
  The forge's fire is ashen-cold\
  No harp is wrung, no hammer falls\
  The darkness dwells in Durin's halls

  The shadow lies upon his tomb\
  In Moria, in Khazad-dûm\
  But still the sunken stars appear\
  In dark and windless Mirrormere

  There lies his crown in water deep\
  'Till Durin wakes again from sleep
