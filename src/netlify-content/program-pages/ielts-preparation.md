  This globally recognized exam is your key to entering thousands of higher
  education institutions and workplaces.


  A truly international university entrance examination, the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is accepted by most Australian, British, Canadian, Irish, New Zealand and South African academic institutions, over 3,000 academic institutions in the United States, and various professional organizations across the world. Our academic IELTS Preparation program will ensure that you have the skills needed to move to the next level of your education and training – whether in the U.S. or overseas.


  Our super-intensive program includes a total of 36 teacher-led lessons per week: 18 lessons of integrated study to improve all English skills; 12 lessons devoted to specific IELTS strategies and skills and 6 lessons of Academic Workshops for additional language practice and skill development.


  Students work with an experienced instructor to hone their ability in the IELTS skills of Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. Practice exams allow instructors to analyze students’ abilities and familiarize students with the test format and strategies.


  Please note that students must possess an English fluency of FLS Level 9 or better to enter the IELTS Preparation Program.
