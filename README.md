# implementation notes & TODOs

## CSS
* should think about transitioning over to SASS/SCSS
* refine the usage of BEM. establish block level names for the main "sections" of the sections of the site, e.g. `programs__`, `locations__`, `about-us__`, etc
* ensure all "experimental" properties are using browser compatability mixines (e.g. `linear-gradent`, `transition`)
